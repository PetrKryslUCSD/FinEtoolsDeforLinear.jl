    ## Solid cylinder/taper/sphere—-temperature loading; quadratic brick mesh
    #
    
    ## Description
    #
    # The solid cylinder/taper/sphere axially-symmetric part represented in
    # Figure 1 is exposed to linearly varying temperature in the plane of the
    # cross-section. The temperature in the coordinates $r$  (the coordinate)
    # and $z$ (the axial ccoordinate)  is given as $T=r+z$. The goal is to find
    # the mechanical stress at the point A induced by the thermal expansion.
    #
    
    ##
    # The part is constrained against axial expansion along the faces of HIH'I'
    # and ABA'B'. The Young's modulus is 210 GPa, the Poisson's ratio is .3,
    # and the coefficient of thermal expansion is 2.3e-4/degree Celsius.
    
    ##
    # This is a test recommended by the National Agency for Finite Element
    # Methods and Standards (U.K.): Test LE11 from NAFEMS Publication TNSB,
    # Rev. 3, “The Standard NAFEMS Benchmarks,” October 1990.
    #
    # Target solution: Compressive  axial stress $\sigma_z$  = –105 MPa along
    # the circle passing through point A.
    
    ##
    # The toolkit has a helpful physical-units facility.  The function phun()
    # allows use of basic  units and basic
    # multipliers (for instance, mega).

    #
    ##
    # The 3-D solution corresponds well to the 2-D axially symmetric model.
    # We also see good correspondence to other published solutions for
    # comparable finite element models.  For instance, Abaqus 6.11
    # Benchmark manual lists very similar numbers.
