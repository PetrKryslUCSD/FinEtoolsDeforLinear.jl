    This is a simple modification of the full three-dimensional simulation of
    the tutorial pub_thick_pipe that implements the axially-symmetric model
    reduction procedure.
    
    An infinitely long thick walled cylindrical pipe
    with inner boundary radius of 3 mm and outer boundary radius of 9 mm is
    subjected to an internal pressure of 1.0 MPa. A wedge   with thickness of
    2 mm and a 90-degree angle sector is considered for the finite element
    analysis. The material properties are taken as  isotropic linear elastic
    with $E=1000$ MPa and $\nu=0.4999$ to represent nearly incompressible
    behavior. This problem has been proposed to by MacNeal and Harder as a
    test of an element's ability to represent the  response of a nearly
    incompressible material. The plane-strain condition is assumed in the
    axial direction of the pipe which together with the radial symmetry
    confines the material in all but the radial direction and therefore
    amplifies the numerical difficulties associated with the confinement of
    the nearly incompressible material.
    
    There is an analytical solution to this problem. Timoshenko and Goodier
    presented the original solution of Lame in their textbook. We are going
    to compare with  both the stress distribution (radial and hoop stresses)
    and the displacement of the inner  cylindrical surface.
