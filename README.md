# FinEtoolsDeforLinear: Linear stress analysis application


[`FinEtools`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtools.jl.git) is a package
for basic operations on finite element meshes. `FinEtoolsDeforLinear` is a
package using `FinEtools` to solve linear stress analysis problems. Included is
statics and dynamics (modal analysis, steady-state vibration).

## News

- 05/27/2024: Remove unsupported functions. Adjust to FinEtools 8.
- 04/25/2024: Add utilities for split of isotropic elastic moduli.

## Tutorials

There are a number of tutorials explaining the use of this package.
Check out the [index](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsDeforLinear.jl/blob/main/tutorials/index.md). The  tutorials themselves can be executed as
follows:

- Download the package or clone it.
```
git clone https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsDeforLinear.jl.git
```
- Change into the `tutorials` folder: `cd .\FinEtoolsDeforLinear.jl\tutorials`.
- Start Julia: `julia`.
- Activate the environment:
```
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate();
```
- Execute the desired tutorial. Here `name.jl` is the name of the tutorial file:
```
include("name.jl")
```

## Examples

Many examples of solving for static and dynamic stress response with continuum FE models are available.
Begin with changing your working directory to the `examples` folder. Activate
and instantiate the examples environment.
```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```
There are a number of examples covering statics and dynamics. The examples may
be executed as described in the  [conceptual guide to
`FinEtools`](https://petrkryslucsd.github.io/FinEtools.jl/latest).
