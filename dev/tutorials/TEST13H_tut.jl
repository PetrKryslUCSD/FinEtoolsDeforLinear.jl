# # TEST 13H: square plate under harmonic loading

# ## Description

# Harmonic forced vibration problem is solved for a homogeneous square plate,
# simply-supported on the circumference. This is the TEST 13H from the Abaqus v
# 6.12 Benchmarks manual. The test is recommended by the National Agency for
# Finite Element Methods and Standards (U.K.): Test 13 from NAFEMS “Selected
# Benchmarks for Forced Vibration,” R0016, March 1993.

# The plate is discretized with hexahedral solid elements. The simple support
# condition is approximated by distributed rollers on the boundary. Because
# only the out of plane displacements are prevented, the structure has three
# rigid body modes in the plane of the plate.

# Homogeneous square plate, simply-supported on the circumference from the test
# 13 from NAFEMS “Selected Benchmarks for Forced Vibration,” R0016, March 1993.
# The nonzero benchmark frequencies are (in hertz): 2.377, 5.961, 5.961, 9.483,
# 12.133, 12.133, 15.468, 15.468 [Hz].
